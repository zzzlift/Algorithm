## Algorithms 
This is a toy algorithm project. Let us first implement some of the main algorithms in the "Introduction to Algorithms" book. But I think this book should not be called an introduction because it is very complicated.

Content: Sort, LinkedList, Binary Search Tree, Graph, Stack, Queue, etc. Time complexity Games.
