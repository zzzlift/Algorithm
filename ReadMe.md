## Algorithms 
This is a toy algorithm project. Let us first implement some of the main algorithms in the "Introduction to Algorithms" book and "Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript" book. But I think the first book should not be called an introduction because it is very complicated.

Content: Sort, LinkedList, Binary Search Tree, Graph, Stack, Queue, Stringã€€(KMP, LCS, DFA) etc. Time complexity Games.
